C++ code example of how to compute average decoding delay using sparse random linear network coding. The implementation is based on the papers "Partial decoding delay of sparse network coding" and "An analytical model for sparse network codes: Field size considerations" published by IEEE Communications Letters in 2018 and 2020, respectively.
